            <h2>Rehabilitation and Reintegration Programs</h2>
            <p>Offering vocational training, psychological counseling, and educational support to help individuals build new skills and find employment.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="skills-training">
            <h2>Skills Training and Employment Support</h2>
            <p>Providing practical training and job placement assistance to ensure sustainable livelihoods for those we assist.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="counseling">
            <h2>Counseling and Mental Health Services</h2>
            <p>Delivering crucial mental health support to address trauma and psychological needs.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="restorative-justice">
            <h2>Restorative Justice Programs</h2>
            <p>Restorative justice approaches focus on repairing harm caused by criminal behavior and promoting accountability, healing, and reconciliation between offenders, victims, and communities. By emphasizing dialogue, restitution, and rehabilitation rather than punitive measures, these programs can address the root causes of crime and prevent future offenses.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="community-based">
            <h2>Community-Based Alternatives to Incarceration</h2>
            <p>Implementing community-based alternatives to incarceration, such as probation, parole, and diversion programs, can help low-risk offenders avoid the negative consequences of imprisonment while still holding them accountable for their actions. These programs can provide supervision, support, and interventions tailored to individual needs, reducing the likelihood of reoffending.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="employment-support">
            <h2>Employment and Housing Support</h2>
            <p>Lack of stable employment and housing can increase the risk of recidivism among ex-offenders. Providing assistance with finding and maintaining employment, as well as accessing affordable housing, can help individuals build stable lives and reduce their involvement in criminal activities.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="mental-health">
            <h2>Mental Health and Substance Abuse Treatment</h2>
            <p>Addressing underlying mental health disorders and substance abuse issues is critical in reducing recidivism. By providing access to mental health treatment, counseling, and substance abuse rehabilitation programs, Kenya can help offenders address the root causes of their criminal behavior and build healthier lives.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="education">
            <h2>Education and Skills Development</h2>
            <p>Investing in education and skills development programs both within correctional facilities and in the community can empower individuals to pursue legitimate opportunities and avoid criminal behavior. Equipping offenders with the education and vocational skills they need to secure employment can significantly reduce their likelihood of reoffending.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="collaboration">
            <h2>Collaboration and Coordination</h2>
            <p>Effective recidivism reduction requires collaboration and coordination among government agencies, non-profit organizations, community stakeholders, and other relevant actors. By working together to identify and address the needs of ex-offenders, Kenya can create a more supportive and effective reentry system.</p>
